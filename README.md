Fullstack Developer Practical Exam for AbrNOC

### How to Run?
1- Install dependencies: `npm i`.

2- Build typescript files: `npm run build`.

I was working on Windows, so `prebuild` script is using PowesShell. to build on Linux open `package.json` file and replce `@powershell rm -r -force ./dist` with `rm -rf ./dist`.

3- Start the app: `npm run start`.

By default, app will start listening on port 3000. you can set port in evnironment by PORT key.

4- Make fun :)
